Visual Argument for ENGCMP0610 (Composing Digital Media)

<h1>First Draft, Oct 12</h1>
<p>For my project, I am arguing that people are looking at screens for an unhealthy amount of time. It's easy to be constantly in front of a screen in today's society, where the expectation is that students, teachers, and workers alike will rely on their computers to complete their daily tasks. As brilliant as computers are, it can be unhealthy to extend our use such that we deprive ourselves of physical activity, fresh air, and sunlight. We can't stop using computers, but we can start going outside. </p>

<p>For my initial draft I've included my GIMP project file as well as the exported JPG. I ask the question "Have you gone outside today?" and include visuals within the word 'outside'. The red eye and horribly postured person are meant to remind the reader why the answer to the question is important. So far, I have only included my own drawing, but in the future I plan to incorporate real photos, whether they be taken from my phone or a public source.</p>
