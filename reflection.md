<h2>Visual Argument Reflection - ENGCMP0610</h2>

  The purpose of my project is to persuade the viewer that they're probably sitting in front of electronics too much and not going outside enough. 
  Through the use of carefully selected design decisions, the visual I have created is able to instill a sense of discomfort within the viewer, a sense that they should associate with the overuse of electronics.
  In order to more effectively persuade the viewer, some of my intentional design implementations include point of focus, simplicity, and contrast.

  My project is formatted as a .gif, and thus includes a few focal points throughout. Originally, the focal point consist of the question, "Have you gone outside today?"
  After a few frames the focal point switches to the back of a person's head as they look at their computer screen. With this transfer of focal points,
  the viewer is subtly given an answer to the posed question and simaltaneously prompted to check themselves. Ideally, they see themselves in the person and are persuaded to turn off their device and step outside.
