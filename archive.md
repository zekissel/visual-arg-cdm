Visual Argument for ENGCMP0610 (Composing Digital Media)

<h3>First Draft, Oct 12</h3>
<p>For my project, I am arguing that people are looking at screens for an unhealthy amount of time. It's easy to be constantly in front of a screen in today's society, where the expectation is that students, teachers, and workers alike will rely on their computers to complete their daily tasks. As brilliant as computers are, it can be unhealthy to extend our use such that we deprive ourselves of physical activity, fresh air, and sunlight. We can't stop using computers, but we can start going outside. </p>

<p>For my initial draft I've included my GIMP project file as well as the exported JPG. I ask the question "Have you gone outside today?" and include visuals within the word 'outside'. The red eye and horribly postured person are meant to remind the reader why the answer to the question is important. So far, I have only included my own drawing, but in the future I plan to incorporate real photos, whether they be taken from my phone or a public source.</p>

<p>For my project, I am arguing that people are looking at screens for an unhealthy amount of time.

<p>With my full draft I've included my updated GIMP project file, my full project (.gif), and the images used to create the GIF. My initial draft was a static picture, but since then I've decided to turn my project into an animation. It was suggested in class that I put my initial visual on a computer screen. I thought that this was a good idea, and reasoned that the best way to convey this would be with an animation. So, I used my first picture as a blueprint for a few more static images. Then, I used the 'Filter' tab in GIMP to cycle through various layers and play them in an animation.</p>

<p>The goal of my project is to convince the viewer to take some time away from their screen and enjoy the outdoors. I believe that making my project into a dynamic animation allows it to catch the attention of the viewer more effectively. The last few pictures at the end of my animation (displaying a person sitting in a dark room) is designed to make the viewer feel guilty, as though that person were representative of them. To finalize my project, I'd like to smooth out the animation more, as well as include more artistic detail.</p>
